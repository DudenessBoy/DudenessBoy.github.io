            Hi, I'm Luke! I'm a hobbyist programmer passionate about creating useful and creative software.
            I enjoy working with Python and exploring various tech projects.
            When I'm not coding, I love gaming and diving into the endless customization options available in KDE Plasma to make my system truly my own.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm 15 years old and currently studying game programming with Unity. I'm always excited to learn new things, improve my skills, and dive deeper into the world of game development.
            I'm passionate about creating unique experiences through coding and enjoy experimenting with different programming techniques.
            Alongside my game programming work, I love designing Minecraft resource packs that make the game more fun and interesting, from textures to sounds.
            Gaming is a big part of my life, and I love combining my interest in gaming with my skills as a programmer.
            When it comes to my development environment, I use Debian Linux with KDE Plasma, which gives me the flexibility to customize my setup exactly how I want it for both productivity and gaming.</p>

            <p>You can check out my projects and open-source software contributions <a href="projects.html">here</a> on my website.</p>
